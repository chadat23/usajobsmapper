                <li>This site is quirky on desktops and laptops, and extra quirky on phones.
                </li>
                <li>While the Location & Radius are applicable globally, the "Zoom to fit Location and Radius" feature only presently
                    works for locations within the US.
                </li>
                <li>Blue map markers denote locatons were jobs are available and where the locations are 
                    believed to be correctly located (but no guarantees are made), 
                    red markers have jobs where, for whatever reason, latitude and longitude couldn't be looked up.
                </li>
                <li>When a red marker is displayed, so that jobs that couldn't be located on the map can still be reported,
                    it's always in a standardized location, so if the map's focused on a Location and Radius, you may not see it/them
                    if you don't scroll or zoom the map (why knows, maybe this will change someday).
                </li>
                <li>Hovering over the field labels will show additional information pertaining for each 
                    respective field.
                </li>
                <li>Adding more search criteria (as opposed to adding more responses to a
                    specific criteria) will generally reduce the number of returned
                    jobs.
                </li>
                <li>Hovering over and/or clicking on map markers will show additional
                    information. (doesn't work on mobile devices where you can't "hover")
                </li>
                <li>Positions shown outside of the Radius circle are additional locations for jobs
                    that have multiple locations where at least one location for each job is within the circle.
                </li>
                <li>All locations for the returned jobs are mapped, even if the initial map view doesn't show them.                    
                </li>
                <li>This site is not affiliated with
                    <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/">USAJOBS</a>,
                    this site maps and presents results retrieved from USAJOBS searches.
                </li>
                <li>Do not assume that this site is returning all results or that it's
                    returning the same results that would be gotten from the same search on USAJOBS.gov.
                    An honest effort has been made to make that happen, but things happen.
